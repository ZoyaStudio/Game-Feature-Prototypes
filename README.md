# Game-Feature-Prototypes

The console programs here are to demontrate features for the game I am making. Most are still works in progress. Later,
they will be re-written for Unreal Game Engine 4.

The game is untitled at the moment.

Fans of video games, book series, TV/film series etc often write fanfiction or otherwise create original plots and characters for their 
favorite series. Many video games incorporate elaborate character customization. Some such as Dragon Age Origins allows the player 
to choose their character's origin. Most customization features are only for creating a user avatar at the beginning of the game.
The most common options for customization are changing appearance, namr, sex and attributes such as skill points, health points, charisma
class (wizard, warrior, hunter).



My intention is to create an RPG where players can create their own characters with ease througout the game as if they were writing fanfiction.
